__DogPic__ is an Android application that demonstrates best practices in modern Android development. It fetches data from the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/), and displays a comprehensive list of dog breeds. It features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, including:
- __Dynamic Search__: Quickly find dog breeds using a responsive search bar that supports real-time filtering.
- __Flexible Layouts__: Custom XML views allow for seamless switch between different predefined layout themes.
- __Event Handling__: User interactions are managed independently through the ViewModel layer, ensuring that business logic is decoupled from the UI.
- __Reactive Asynchronous Programming__: The app leverages Kotlin Coroutines and StateFlow for efficient, non-blocking data fetching and UI updates, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. This approach enables the app to handle network latency and large data sets gracefully, while maintaining seamless UI performance.

The app is built using a modular and scalable architecture to ensure maintainability and testability. It leverages modern Android development tools and practices, including:

- __MVVM Pattern__: Separating business logic from UI to facilitate testing and maintainability.
- __Multi-Module Architecture__: For better separation of concerns, faster build times, and more flexible code management.
- __Clean Architecture__: Following Uncle Bob's principles, separating the application into multiple layers (data, domain, and presentation) to achieve a clean and maintainable codebase.
- __Dagger-Hilt__: For dependency injection, reducing boilerplate code and improving the testability of the app.

This project reflects industry standards for building scalable, maintainable, and testable Android applications. By adhering to modern development practices and utilizing a clean architecture, making it easily extensible and adaptable to future changes.
